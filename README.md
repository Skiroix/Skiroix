- 👋 Hi, I’m Adrian Nowek
- 👀 I’m interested in making websites, python programming and Computer Vision
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js and Open CV for python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at this very moment (sorry)
- 📫 As for now the best way to contact me is by email (adrian.nowek11@gmail.com) but I'm currently working on my own portfolio website which is going to provide more ways of doing so
